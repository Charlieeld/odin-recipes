        <li>10 cherry tomatos halved</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce</li>

    <h2>directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander and place over a bowl to drain.</li>
        <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a 4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and immediately top with thin basil slices. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
